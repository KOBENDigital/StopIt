# StopIt
Created at UDUF 2025, an Umbraco package to prevent backoffice users from renaming, moving or deleting content or media

# Permissions

The property visibility is permission based, only users with required permission will be allowed to view or edit the toggle to prevent renaming, moving or deleting content or media.

# Extensions

Currently the toggle is only available for the Media folder,  future extension is to allow this toggle to be used across any content type.
